# go-tutorial

This repository is just for personal reference as I make my way through the various tutorials at [www.golang.org](https://www.golang.org), including [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org).

Much of the code in this repo is provided in the tutorials, but the solutions for the Tour of Go exercises are almost entirely my own.
